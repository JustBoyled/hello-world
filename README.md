Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.
Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.
Only the Avatar, master of all four elements could stop them,
but when the world needed him most, he vanished.
100 years have passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang.
Although his airbending skills are great, he still has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.
But I believe,
AANG CAN SAVE THE WORLD
